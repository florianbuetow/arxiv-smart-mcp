# Development Rules for arxivsmart

This file provides guidance to AI agents and AI-assisted development tools when working with this project. This includes Claude Code, Cursor IDE, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, and any other AI coding assistants.

## General Coding Principles
- **Never assume any default values anywhere**
- Always be explicit about values, paths, and configurations
- If a value is not provided, handle it explicitly (raise error, use null, or prompt for input)

## Git Commit Guidelines

**IMPORTANT:** When creating git commits in this repository:
- **NEVER include AI attribution in commit messages**
- **NEVER add "Generated with [AI tool name]" or similar phrases**
- **NEVER add "Co-Authored-By: [AI name]" or similar attribution**
- **NEVER run `git add -A` or `git add .` - always stage files explicitly**
- Keep commit messages professional and focused on the changes made
- Commit messages should describe what changed and why, without mentioning AI assistance
- **ALWAYS run `git push` after creating a commit to push changes to the remote repository**
- **NEVER use `git -C <path>`** — always run git commands from the project root directory

## Testing
- After **every change** to the code, the tests must be executed
- Always verify the service runs correctly with `just start` after modifications

## Python Execution Rules
- Python code must be executed **only** via `uv run ...`
  - Example: `uv run src/main.py`
  - **Never** use: `python src/main.py` or `python3 src/main.py`
- The virtual environment must be created and updated **only** via `uv sync`
  - **Never** use: `pip install`, `python -m pip`, or `uv pip`
- All dependencies must be managed through `uv` and declared in `pyproject.toml`

## Justfile Rules
- All Python execution in the justfile uses `uv run`, never `python` directly
- Use `just init` to set up the project
- Use `just start` to start the arxivsmart service (foreground)
- Use `just stop` to stop the running service
- Use `just status` to check service status and configuration
- Use `just destroy` to remove the virtual environment
- Use `just help` to see all available recipes with descriptions
- Use `just` (with no arguments) to see a list of all recipes
- Use `just ci` to run all validation checks (verbose)
- Use `just ci-quiet` to run all validation checks (silent, fail-fast)

## Project Structure
- All source code lives in `src/`
- **Never create Python files in the project root directory**
  - Wrong: `./test.py`, `./helper.py`
  - Correct: `./src/helper.py`

## Error Handling
- **Fail fast** — if something is wrong, report it immediately and stop
- **No error masking** — never swallow exceptions or continue processing after a failure
- Errors must propagate immediately with descriptive messages
